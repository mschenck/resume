accomplishments:
  title: Noteworthy Accomplishments
  entries:
  - Worked with several teams to manage an acquisition, reverse engineering undocumented code and recreated a working environment, updated documentation and established an on-boarding process
  - Lead K8s (EKS) upgrade from 1.20 to 1.22 including updating a 3 year old ingress-nginx deploy and updating an in-house service to adhere to k8s API deprecations, followed by an after-action presentation
  - Designed a next generation perimeter to overcome capacity planning, scaling and availability challenges in collaboration with network engineering and security
  - Contributed both code and design to in-house ingress controller including refactoring of controllers to support horizontal scalability (kubebuilder in Golang)
  - Established a mentoring plan with retrospectives to improve consistency, outcomes and visibility of mentoring efforts
  - Designed and implemented Ikos' data oriented architecture backend for flexibility driving reduced time to value for product initiatives (in python)
  - Implemented Ikos’ minimal yet pragmatic platform providing product and service build pipelined, continuous delivery releases with full stack monitoring and logging
  - Implemented a learning, ownership and blameless culture through design docs, team based technology decisions, postmortems and SCRUM
  - Owned Tumblr perimeter; partitioned perimeter into functional-pools tuned around traffic profile (connection lifetime, consumer type, cacheability, and bandwidth volume directionality), drove the seamless transition of active core-site during data center migration, and expansion of insight for both performance and DoS attack insight, and created a proxy-driven high-availability topology for Varnish caching tier, which is dynamically regenerated with Configrr::Haproxy
  - Implemented lossless high volume metric trending system based on OpenTSDB, Collectd, and Fibr; a graph dashboard application based on Ruby’s Sinatra framework and Ohm library
  - Contributor to many companion projects making up the rich Collins ecosystem, including Phil, Invisible-Touch, Fibr, and Configrr. Ranging from original development effort, optimization, expanding Rspec coverage, and in the case of Configrr - leading the effort to open-source.
  - Application stack optimizations through application profiling, restructuring components into role-based pools, and replacing a proprietary solution with off-the-shelf hardware that best fit our workload.
